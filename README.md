# ContactTracing
This will use flask and html to ask you questions about where you traveled and when you got covid. I will try toadd a database and make the submit button work. I also need to change the files to not just work in repl.it and also work elsewhere. 

Suggestions: Use repl.it to run this. Although it's slower, it's an ide that should be familar and setup is easy.
