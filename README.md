# ContactTracing
This will use flask and html to ask you questions about where you traveled and when you got covid. I will try toadd a database and make the submit button work. I also need to change the files to not just work in repl.it and also work elsewhere. 

Suggestions: Use repl.it to run this. Although it's slower, it's an ide that should be familar and setup is easy. If you are cloning this to repl.it be sure to do in the .replit file or something similar for the language = "python3" and run = "python run.py"

Current issue: Website is giving 404
